HiP-Auth
======
HiP-Auth is an Authentication and Authorization service built and maintained by [HiPCMS](https://github.com/HiP-App/HiP-CmsWebApi) which is a content management system developed by the project group [History in 
Paderborn](http://is.uni-paderborn.de/fachgebiete/fg-engels/lehre/ss15/hip-app/pg-hip-app.html).

HiP-Auth is currently acting as a microservice for HiPCMS. Nevertheless it can be consumed by any application which requires token based authentication.
We also develop a [REST API](https://github.com/HiP-App/HiP-CmsWebApi) and a [Client app](https://github.com/HiP-App/HiP-CmsAngularApp) which uses this service. The REST API is built on .NET Core 1.0 and client app is developed on Angular2.
